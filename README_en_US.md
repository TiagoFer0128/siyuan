## ‚ùì FAQs

### How does SiYuan store data?

The data is saved in the workspace folder (the default is in the user's home directory Documents/SiYuan, which can be modified in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd>), in the workspace data folder:

* `assets` are used to save all inserted asset files
* `templates` are used to save template snippets
* `widgets` are used to save widgets
* `emojis` are uaed to save emoji images
* The rest of the folders are the notebook folders created by the user, files with the suffix of `.sy` in the notebook folder are used to save the document data, and the data format is JSON

### Is SiYuan open source?

Currently, it is not completely open source, but in order to ensure the portability of data, [Data Parser](https://github.com/88250/protyle) and [Editor Engine](https://github.com/88250/ lute) is completely open source.

### Is there any Note for deleting docs?

After deletion, the doc will not appear in the operating system's recycle bin, but will be deleted directly. When deleted, SiYuan will generate edit history.

### How can I just wrap and not start a new paragraph?

Please use <kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd>.

### How to indent at the beginning of a Chinese paragraph?

Please use full-width spaces so that the content can be aligned after it is automatically wrapped.

### How to move the heading and blocks below it?

Fold the heading and move it later.

### How to select multiple blocks across pages?

Click at the beginning, hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> and click at the end after scrolling the page.

### How to adjust table rows and columns?

There is an operation entry in the block icon menu of the table block.

### How to use a third-party sync disk for data synchronization?

* Please only synchronize the `workspace/data/`, do not synchronize the entire workspace
* Please suspend third-party synchronization during the operation of SiYuan, otherwise data may be damaged. For details, please refer to [here](https://ld246.com/article/1626537583158)
* The data folder path on the Android is `internal storage device/Android/data/org.b3log.siyuan/files/siyuan/data/`, which is a private path of the application and cannot be read by other programs and can only be copied manually
* There is a conflict between third-party synchronization and SiYuan synchronization, please do not use at the same time

### Do you plan to support plugins?

SiYuan supports use on browser,  which can be extended by browser plug-ins. We are looking forward to other developers writing browser plug-ins for SiYuan. With the gradual provision of Kernel API , we will introduce a plug-in mechanism in the future.

### Do I need to pay for it?

Local functions are completely free to use, [Cloud services](https://b3log.org/siyuan/pricing.html) requires annual subscription, price is $64/year„ÄÇ

Users in non-Mainland China regions should not pay for subscriptions, because SiYuan Cloud Server cannot guarantee availability in non-Mainland China regions.
